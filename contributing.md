## Adding to This List by Pull Request

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

* Search previous list entries before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
* Make sure the entry is useful before submitting. (That implies it is easily accessible, currently useful as software or a reference, and has undergone some type of professional review.)
* Make an individual pull request for each added entry.
* Add the new entry in alphabetical order in the appropriate category.
* Use [title-casing](http://titlecase.com) (AP style).
* Use the following format: `* [Resource Name](link)`
* New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
* The pull request and commit should have a *useful* title.
* The body of your commit message should contain a link to the software or reference you are adding.

## Updating your Pull Request

Sometimes, a maintainer of this list may ask you to edit your Pull Request before it is included. This is normally due to spelling errors or because your PR didn't match the awesome list guidelines or Code of Conduct.

[Here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) is a write up on how to change a Pull Request, and the different ways you can do that.
